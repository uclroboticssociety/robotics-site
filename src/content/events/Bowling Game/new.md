We teamed up once again with KCL Robotics Society for a fun evening of bowling and darts at Bloomsbury Lanes. Members from both societies showed off impressive strikes, some questionable aim, and plenty of friendly competition along the way.

After bowling, the group moved over to the darts area, where accuracy and physics knowledge didn’t always line up. Between matches, people shared stories from their robotics projects, and swapped ideas for future collaborations. It was a perfect night full of competition and camaraderie, giving students a chance to connect beyond the workshop environment.
