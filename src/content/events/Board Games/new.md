To kick off the new year, we hosted a relaxed board games social, giving members a chance to unwind, meet new people, and share a few laughs outside the workshops. The event featured a lively mix of classic and modern tabletop games, with a heated game of Twister transpiring.

It was a huge success and set a welcoming tone for the rest of the year’s activities. With laughter, snacks, and a few surprising moments of competitive spirit, it was exciting and fun to meet everyone!
