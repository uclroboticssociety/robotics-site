In collaboration with King’s College London Robotics Society, we hosted our second Film Night of the term. Members gathered to enjoy “The Iron Giant”, a timeless animated classic exploring the bond between a young boy and a giant robot with a heart. It was a wonderful opportunity to mingle with other robotics society students.

From artificial intelligence and empathy in machines to what it really means to be human in a world of robots, the movie sparked great discussion and introspection on our current technological climate. With popcorn in hand, great company, and plenty of thoughtful conversations, we had a delightful time watching the film at King’s Strand campus.

We are excited to continue our collaboration with KCL, and looking forward to our adventures ahead together!
