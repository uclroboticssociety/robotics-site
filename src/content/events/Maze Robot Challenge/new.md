The Maze Robot Challenge is a hands-on robotics challenge where teams design, program, and test a mobile robot to autonomously navigate through a maze.\n
!!!/
/!!!
Building on the skills introduced in earlier Arduino and motor control sessions, participants will apply sensor integration, basic navigation logic, and teamwork to solve a real-world robotics problem in a competitive but beginner-friendly environment.

## What you’ll do
**Participants will work in small teams to:**
- Assemble a basic maze-solving robot
- Integrate sensors, motors, and an Arduino controller
- Upload and test navigation code
- Iteratively improve robot performance through testing
!!!/

/!!!
## What you’ll learn
- Fundamental robot navigation concepts
- How sensors (IR / ultrasonic) are used for decision making
- Basic control logic for mobile robots
- Practical experience with hardware integration and debugging

## The Challenge
**Once the robots are ready, teams will compete to:**
- Navigate the maze as efficiently as possible
- Optimise speed, stability, and decision-making
- Collaborate under time constraints
- The focus is on learning through experimentation, not just winning.
