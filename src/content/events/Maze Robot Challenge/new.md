/!!!
The Maze Robot Challenge was a hands-on robotics challenge where teams designedprogrammed, and tested a mobile robot to autonomously navigate through a maze.

/!!!
Building on the skills introduced in earlier Arduino and motor control sessions, participantsapplied sensor integration, basic navigation logic, and teamwork to solve a real-world roboticsproblem in a competitive but beginner-friendly environment.

## What participant did
**Participants workedin small teams to:**
- Assemble a basic maze-solving robot
- Integrate sensors, motors, and an Arduino controller
- Upload and test navigation code
- Iteratively improve robot performance through testing
!!!/

/!!!
## What participants learned
- Fundamental robot navigation concepts
- How sensors (lR/ultrasonic) are used for decision making
- Basic control logic for mobile robots
- Practical experience with hardware integration and debugging

## The Challenge
**Once the robots were ready,teams competed to:**
- Navigate the maze as efficiently as possible
- Optimise speed, stability, and decision-making
- Collaborate under time constraints
- The focus was on learning through experimentation, not just winning
