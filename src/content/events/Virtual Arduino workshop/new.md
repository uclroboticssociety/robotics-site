## 🗂️ 2. Session Structure

### Part 1 — Society Schedule Induction

- **Workshops**
  - Term 1: CAD & 3D printings; Arduino & Sensors
  - Term 2: Control Basics (PID, Kinematics, Inverse Kinematics, Lagrangian Mechanics)
  - Term 3: ROS for beginners; Integrated Projects
- **Hackathons**
  - Hackathon participation support (team formation, prep sessions, guidance)
  - Plans for hosting our own hackathon next year with other universities
- **Talks & Industry**
  - Inviting industry experts and company leaders to share latest tech & experiences
- **RoboCup**
  - A small group of people will do the demo at first and then mass produce

### Part 2 — Virtual Arduino Workshop

- **Overview:** This workshop is designed to introduce beginners to Arduino programming and hardware interaction using an online simulation platform called Wokwi. Wokwi allows users to write Arduino code on the left side of the interface, while adding and connecting components (such as sensors, motors, LEDs, and microcontrollers) on the right side, enabling a fully virtual, hands-on experience without physical hardware.
- **Introduction to Wokwi Platform**
  - How to navigate the interface
  - How to add and connect components
  - How the simulation works
- **Project 1: LED Control (Running Light Example)**
  - Basics of digital output
  - Writing simple Arduino code to turn LEDs on/off
  - Implementing a "running light" (sequential LED blinking) program
- **Project 2: PWM Control — Servo & DC Motor**
  - Introduction to PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)
  - Controlling a servo motor's angle
  - Controlling a DC motor's speed
